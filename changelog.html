      <p>30.9.2016</p>
      <p>Statistics page now shows how many refugees you get on next reset. CHANGED REFUGEE FORMULA, this will probably screw up saves that have gotten really far. Added an indicator how much time until arrival.</p>
      <br>
      <p>27.9.2016</p>
      <p>Multiple small changes. Added max everything button NOTE: it does not work for first parts.</p>
      <br>
      <p>23.9.2016</p>
      <p>Added options tab where you can change notation and disable background animation (disabling it greatly reduces CPU usage)</p>
      <br>
      <p>22.9.2016
      <p>Added visualization of the ship and cleaned intervals a bit. Commented the code.
